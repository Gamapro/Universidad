He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1L and fitted with twin turbos, that produces unmeasurable amounts of horsepower (800hp). He also finds that the car''s previous owner had the same first AND last name as Akio (Asakura Akio) and had died in a horrible crash on the Wangan. Every person who buys the Z and fixes it up ends up spinning out of control and crashing, as if the car is rebelling against it''s driver. This gives the blue Z the nickname "The Devil Z". The manga follows Akio''s various encounters with people on the Wangan, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for Wangan superiority.');

However, as they grew up, the stark difference between them became evident. While Yuno is able to wield magic with amazing power and control, Asta cannot use magic at all and desperately tries to awaken his powers by training physically. When they reach the age of 15, Yuno is bestowed a spectacular Grimoire with a four-leaf clover, while Asta receives nothing. However, soon after, Yuno is attacked by a person named Lebuty, whose main purpose is to obtain Yuno''s Grimoire. Asta tries to fight Lebuty, but he is outmatched.

Unleashing his inner emotions in a rage, Asta receives a five-leaf clover Grimoire, a "Black Clover" giving him enough power to defeat Lebuty. A few days later, the two friends head out into the world, both seeking the same goal—to become the Wizard King!');

Introduced in Japan in 1998 as part of the Bemani series, and released in North America and Europe in 1999, Dance Dance Revolution is the pioneering series of the rhythm and dance genre in video games. Players stand on a "dance platform" or stage and hit colored arrows laid out in a cross with their feet to musical and visual cues. Players are judged by how well they time their dance to the patterns presented to them and are allowed to choose more music to play to if they receive a passing score.Dance Dance Revolution has been given much critical acclaim for its originality and stamina in the video game market. There have been dozens of arcade-based releases across several countries and hundreds of home video game console releases, promoting a music library of original songs produced by Konami''s in-house artists and an eclectic set of licensed music from many different genres. The DDR series has inspired similar games such as Pump It Up by Andamiro and In the Groove by Roxor. The latest release is Dance Dance Revolution A, which premiered in 2016.');

The main character, Gaou Mikado has just started Buddyfighting. As the story progresses, Buddyfights are seeming to become a little too real...');

Under Hitler''s leadership, the country has undergone monumental development, overcoming the humiliation of its World War I loss and growing into a fearsome military superpower. As Hitler addresses the growth of his nation, he reaffirms the importance of the German nationalistic spirit and warns against the arising Jewish threat. As he finishes his speech, Hitler raises his right arm in a final salute amidst the thundering roar of the crowd, having full confidence that he and his country will make their mark on history.Growing up in a small town in Austria, Hitler was introduced to German nationalism at a young age. His parents had opposing views on his early interest in art—harsh disapproval from his father and loving support from his mother. As a result, he was unfazed by the death of his father, yet utterly devastated by the death of his mother. Eventually, he applied to a fine arts school in Vienna, and to his frustration, was rejected immediately. This forced him to live on the streets, where he was was first exposed to antisemitism. Though skeptical at first, Hitler eventually adopts this ideology, soon transforming into a charismatic leader—and an influential one who would shift the balance of power in the world and dramatically alter the course of history.');

Her name is Lacia, one of five highly advanced hIEs that recently escaped the clutches of the mysterious MemeFrame Corporation.Faced with a hacked car threatening to run them over, Lacia offers Arato a deal: in exchange for saving his life, he must register as her new owner, thus taking full responsibility for her actions. With little choice, he decides to trust this artificial girl and allows her to live in his home. Though Lacia begins to adapt to her new, peaceful lifestyle, she warns the entranced Arato of one thing—she does not have a soul.[Written by MAL Rewrite]');

Children raised here are trained to pilot giant mechas known as FranXX—the only weapons known to be effective against the Klaxosaurs—in boy-girl pairs. Bred for the sole purpose of piloting these machines, these children know nothing of the outside world and are only able to prove their existence by defending their race. Hiro, an aspiring FranXX pilot, has lost his motivation and self-confidence after failing an aptitude test. Skipping out on his class'' graduation ceremony, Hiro retreats to a forest lake, where he encounters a mysterious girl with two horns growing out of her head. She introduces herself by her codename Zero Two, which is known to belong to an infamous FranXX pilot known as the "Partner Killer." Before Hiro can digest the encounter, the Plantation is rocked by a sudden Klaxosaur attack. Zero Two engages the creature in her FranXX, but it is heavily damaged in the skirmish and crashes near Hiro. Finding her partner dead, Zero Two invites Hiro to pilot the mecha with her, and the duo easily defeats the Klaxosaur in the ensuing fight. With a new partner by his side, Hiro has been given a chance at redemption for his past failures, but at what cost?[Written by MAL Rewrite]');

In his search for housing, he''s introduced to a very cheap boarding house called Yuragi Manor, which was formerly a popular hot springs inn. It''s so cheap because the house is haunted by the spirit of a high school student whose corpse was found there.Kogarashi doesn''t think this is going to be a problem for him, and the rest of the house''s tenants appear to be sexy women.

Kogarashi has no desire to hurt a ghost girl, and instead he ends up agreeing to help her to figure out her unfinished business.

INSERT INTO Series(id, name, description) VALUES (2863,N'Dragon Quest V',N'Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride[a] is a role-playing video game and the fifth installment in the Dragon Quest video game series. Originally developed by Chunsoft and published by Enix Corporation, Dragon Quest V was the first title in the series to be released for the Nintendo Super Famicom (SFC) video game console in Japan in September 1992. Dragon Quest V was the first game in the series to not be released outside Japan, as Enix did not want to pay for the cost of the larger cartridge ROMs needed to fit English-language dialog. Poor sales of Dragon Quest II, Dragon Quest III, and Dragon Quest IV in North America were also a factor.It later had an enhanced remake only in Japan for the PlayStation 2 in 2004; which was developed by ArtePiazza and Matrix Software.[7]. Another remake was made for the Nintendo DS, which released in Japan in July 2008 and worldwide in February 2009, marking the first time the game had officially released in English.[2][8][6] In addition, ports for Android and iOS were released in Japan in December 2014, and worldwide the following month.[5]The game takes place over roughly thirty years of the main character''s life, from when he is born through to when he gets married and has a family. The title introduced a gameplay dynamic in which monsters from random encounters may offer to join the player''s party. This concept was used in later Dragon Quest games, as well as in the Dragon Quest Monsters series as the primary way to form a party. The game''s monster-collecting concept has since become influential, appearing in many later franchises such as Pokémon, Digimon and Dokapon.[9] In turn, the concept of collecting everything in a game, in the form of achievements or similar rewards, has since become a common trend in video games.[9] Dragon Quest V has also been credited as the first known video game to feature a playable pregnancy, a concept that has since appeared in later games such as Story of Seasons, The Sims 2 and Fable II.[10]');
